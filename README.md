An intuitively creative full stack developer motivated by learning and problem solving. I learned to code Ruby, JavaScript and Python full stack applications in 12 weeks at Makers Academy, an intensive coding bootcamp in London, UK.


## Projects

During my time at Makers Academy I worked in an agile development environment with different developers through paired-programming, mobbing and project based group-work. Working with others during the course I practised XP values and learned the importance of test driven development (TDD) especially as we built up programs with more features. Here is a selection of individual and group projects I've created and contributed to recently:

| Project |Description| Technologies | Testing & Quality Metrics |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| [Moments (Instagram Challenge)](http://moments.ddregalo.co.uk)| GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/ddregalo/instagram-challenge">HERE</a>. Instagram-inspired image sharing social web application. Created as a solo project with some guidance for AWS EC2 implementation. |Ruby on Rails, AWS EC2, Devise, Omniauth, Google Oauth2, Paperclip, HTML, CSS | RSpec, Travis-CI, SimpleCov, Rubocop, Better Code Hub|
| [AceBook - Dart (Facebook Challenge)](http://http://team-dart.herokuapp.com/) | GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/ddregalo/instagram-challenge">HERE</a>. See blog posts I wrote HERE Facebook-inspired post sharing social web application with a darts theme. Group Project with 5 developers working with Ruby on Rails for the first time. My Role - implementing basic post features, comments, testing, setup Amazon S3 Bucket for saving user avatars (Paperclip gem), implement Devise for user authentication, frontend jQuery, CSS styling and writing blog posts you can read <a href="https://medium.com/@teamdartlondon">HERE</a>. | Ruby on Rails, AWS S3, jQuery, HTML, CSS | Rspec-rails, SimpleCov, Travis-CI, Rubocop, CodeClimate |
| [Gilded Rose (Tech Test Challenge)](https://github.com/ddregalo/gilded-rose/tree/master/js) | Kata developed by Terry Hughes. Used as a tech test to assess a candidate's ability to read, refactor and extend legacy code. | JavaScript | Jasmine, ESLint |
| [Nice APP (Mobile App - iOS + Android)](https://github.com/RandJam/nice) | A mobile app for iOS and Android that facilitates charitable donations using Just Giving API - Group project (4 developers learning Python and React Native for the first time). My Role - work on basic routes and backend logic (Python, Flask), testing with Pytest, screen + button design (React Native) and writing project blog posts.| Python, Flask, React Native, MongoDB | Pytest, Coverage.py, Jest/Enzyme |


## Skills

#### Problem Solving
Using a logical process-based technique, I enjoy tackling 'impossible tasks' by breaking them down into smaller packets of well-defined challenges that can be expanded into viable solutions. I think it is important to approach each problem with a good understanding of the specifications while also being open to new perspectives and multiple solutions. I believe a well understood and defined problem is a problem half solved.

#### Fast-Learner
Within a 16 week program at Makers Academy I learned 3 languages from scratch (Ruby, JavaScript, Python) and applied them to building web applications as well as a mobile app for iOS and Android using React Native. I learned to enjoy and thrive in the unknown and love the challenge and reward that learning provides.

#### Communication
Working with different developers on a daily basis allowed me to develop great communication skills specifically working in paired-programming, mob teams and group projects. Sharing ideas, logic and working styles was essential to a great workflow and keeping the team motivated and productive. Communication, like code, should be easy to understand for everyone involved.

#### Initiative and Leadership
Working as an exhibitions manager I was responsible for the gallery exhibitions and internship program. I organised 7 exhibitions with many partners and hired, trained and worked with 6 interns during this time. Working as part of a motivated team that actively involves everyone is a skill that I learned and applied in software development by actively meeting with fellow programmers for assistance, skill sharing as well as assisting others while reinforcing my knowledge.

#### Creativity
As an abstract artist I love expression and creativity. Code, while technical and precise, is also a creative process for me, iterating and refactoring until I develop something amazing. I believe my creative side helps me not only with design and composition, but also in being open to different approaches and solutions to challenges.
