An intuitively creative junior full stack developer motivated by problem solving. I learned to code full stack applications in Ruby and Javascript in 12 weeks at Makers Academy, an intensive coding bootcamp in London, UK.


## Projects

During my time at Makers I worked in agile development with many different developers through paired-programming, mobbing and project based group-work. Here is a selection of individual and group projects I've created and contributed to recently:

## Skills

#### Problem Solving
Using a logical process-based technique, I enjoy tackling 'impossible tasks' by breaking them down into smaller packets of well-defined challenges that can be expanded into viable solutions. I think it is important to approach each problem with a deep consideration of the specifications while also being open to new perspectives and multiple solutions.  


#### Communication

My experience of starting my own construction company helped me develop excellent communication skills by dealing with multiple stakeholders (client, suppliers, other contractors) on multiple projects at the same time. It was crucial to be organised and communicate material shipments with multiple suppliers to different locations while also managing the deliveries with the client. I also sharpened my customer service skills by dealing with clients face-to-face while doing quotes, sales and job feedback reviews.


#### Creativity

As a freelance fine arts consultant I assisted in curating collections of artworks for high-end commercial clients. I made relationships with various galleries and selected artworks that best accentuated each space while also making sure the needs of the client are met. This process involves managing various environmental conditions such as installation, lighting, security and marketing/branding that combined as a whole, communicate a clear vision with an appealing aesthetic.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Feb 2018 to May 2018)

- Curious and passionate about code: Making ideas 'real' really gets me pumped and I love a good challenge. I have recently started learning multiple languages (ruby, php) and sharpening my skills on Codewars Katas as well as creating programs in my free time that interest me.
- Fast, independent learner: I went from absolutely zero programming experience to programming a code that used APIs to get specific data from a website to create a dashboard on a local computer with the help of a great pairing partner.
- Great collaborator: I love working in paired programming sessions both in-person and remotely. I work well in groups both as a leader and in supporting roles. Driven, personable and enthusiastic are characteristics often used to describe me.

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Calgary (2004 to 2008)

- Bachelor of Commerce : Petroleum Land Management
- Honors GPA 3.72
- John Shirra Scholarship for Entrepreneurial Spirit

#### Teaching English Foreign Language (TEFL) Certificate

Oxford Seminars 100-hour TESOL/TESL/TEFL Certificate. I taught english to children and professional adults in China for 1 year.
