## Daniel Campos

I am a junior developer in-the-making currently enrolled at Makers Academy (London).

My work history is pretty diverse—I’ve been a freelance fine art consultant, art gallery exhibitions manager, construction company owner, English teacher in China and an oil & gas contracts administrator. I’m stoked to be making the leap into coding this year as way to unite my creativity and problem solving skills but most importantly my enthusiasm for turning ideas into something of value and function.



## Skills


#### Problem Solving

I enjoy the challenge and process of working through problems and applying a logical approach. Some of the challenges I’ve come across:

- Coordinating the collection and delivery of over 50 artworks from busy international collectors to the same museum for an exhibition in a short time frame within a budget.
- Designing custom solutions for odd-shaped rooflines on construction projects to ensure the building is waterproof. 


#### Communication

My experience of starting my own construction company helped me develop excellent communication skills by dealing with multiple stakeholders (client, suppliers, other contractors) on multiple projects at the same time. It was crucial to be organized and communicate material shipments with multiple suppliers to different locations while also managing the deliveries with the client. I also sharpened my customer service skills by dealing with clients face-to-face while doing quotes, sales and job feedback reviews.


#### Creativity

As a freelance fine arts consultant I assisted in curating collections of artworks for high-end commercial clients. I made relationships with various galleries and selected artworks that best accentuated each space while also making sure the needs of the client are met. This process involves managing various environmental conditions such as installation, lighting, security and marketing/branding that combined as a whole, communicate a clear vision with an appealing aesthetic.

## Education


#### Makers Academy (Feb 2018 to May 2018)

- Curious and passionate about code: Making ideas 'real' really gets me pumped and I love a good challenge. I have recently started learning multiple languages (ruby, php) and sharpening my skills on Codewars Katas as well as creating programs in my free time that interest me.
- Fast, independent learner: I went from absolutely zero programming experience to programming a code that used APIs to get specific data from a website to create a dashboard on a local computer with the help of a great pairing partner.
- Great collaborator: I love working in paired programming sessions both in-person and remotely. I work well in groups both as a leader and in supporting roles. Driven, personable and enthusiastic are characteristics often used to describe me.
